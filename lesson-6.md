# 6. Conclusion & Additional Resources

## Congratulations, you finished the workshop! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠðŸ¥³

Throughout the workshop you: 

- Built a REST API with NestJS
- Smoothly integrated Prisma in a NestJS project
- Documented your REST API using Swagger and OpenAPI
- Implemented input validation with NestJS Pipes
- Implemented error handling with NestJS Exception filters
- Implemented end-to-end testing with Jest

Thatâ€™s a lot of cool stuff, you should be proud of yourself! 

## Where to go from here?

You should now have some of the basic knowledge necessary to continue your exploration of NestJS. I would personally suggest trying to expand this codebase with more features. A few ideas: 

- Add another endpoint, for example, a  `/users` endpoint.
- Add unit-testing
- Add rate limiting
- Add caching
- Add authentication and authorization
- Add pagination
- Add continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- â€¦etc

*You could also try building something completely new!*
